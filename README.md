## Installation

- [Fork this repository][fork]
- Clone it: `git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USER/lagom`
- Install the [GitHub Pages gem][pages] (includes Jekyll): `bundle install`
- Run the jekyll server: `jekyll serve`

You should have a server up and running locally at <http://localhost:4000>.

## Customization

Next you'll want to change a few things. Most of them can be changed directly in
[theme.yml][config]. That's where you can add your social links, change the accent
color, stuff like that.

There's a few other places that you'll want to change, too:

- [CNAME][cname]: If you're using this on GitHub Pages with a custom domain name, 
  you'll want to change this to be the domain you're going to use. All that should 
  be in here is a domain name on the first line and nothing else (like: `example.com`).
- [favicon.png][favicon]: This is the icon in your browser's address bar. You should 
  change it to whatever you'd like.
- [logo.png][logo]: A square-ish image that appears in the upper-left corner

## Deployment

You should deploy with [GitHub Pages][pages] - it's just easier.

All you should have to do is rename your repository on GitHub to be
`username.github.io`. Since everything is on the `gh-pages` branch, you
should be able to see your new site at <http://username.github.io>.
