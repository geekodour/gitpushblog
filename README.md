# gitpushblog
- A static blog generator.
- A set of npm scripts that make it easy to build a blog using the **githubAPI** and **nunjucks**.

It is like [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), but currently does limited stuff.

see a [live demo]() here

# Table of contents

## Features
- uses npm scripts
- uses github api
- offline markdown draft support, live editing*
- built with webpack and sass support

## Limitations
- Uses only nunjucks for now, let me know if to add support of any other
- I am thinking to add gatsby(react) support
- see issues for others

# Why another static site generator

There was not much of a need, but I guess it's fun, also I wanted to use something like
Jekyll but not Jekyll.
**gitpushblog** is suitable for personal blogs for people who use github regularly.
Here's the idea,

Github Element | Blog Element
------------ | -------------
Issues | BlogPosts
Issue comments | BlogPosts comments
Issue labels | BlogPosts categories

The GithubAPI is not directory accessed, instead it uses a [github-blog-api](https://www.npmjs.com/package/github-blog-api)
that I created, using that npm package you can make a fully client side blog if you want to, but here we're using it to generate
the static content.

## Installation and Quick Start
for the quickstart we're using 

- `fork` this repository
- enable `issues` in the forked repository (in repository settings).
- change the name of the repository if you want.
- `clone` the forked repository.
- run `npm install`.
- run `npm run dev`
After it shows `REVISION 0 GENERATED` open `localhost:3000` in your browser.
check the newly created `dev` directory in the project root, (it's gitignored, so no worries)

# Usage

It is very simple to use, just configure `blog_config.json` to setup your blog.
and there are four simple commands to interact with your blog from the cli,
`npm run dev`
`npm run new <draft_name.md>`
`npm run generate`
`npm run upload`
`npm run push`
`npm run push:only`

Here's a example directory structure of a generated blog

paraphrasing a github comment related to the use of github issues for blogposts

> **first person:** I don't really like the idea of "exploiting" GitHub issues for blog comments.
> This is obviously not a designed feature of GitHub API and it feels like an abuse of GitHub service.
> **second person:** To me this feels like something GitHub would approve of. GitHub Issues intentionally gives users a lot of freedom so they can use it however they want. Unlike competitors who forced you to do something a certain way.
> This is creative, and if your blog is hosted via GitHub Pages, then using Issues to discuss the content is not far-fetched at all.

# Setup
There are **two ways** to setup this blogging system,

## 1. Use the generator (NOT YET DONE)
Simply installing and running the blog generator cli app is the easiest, it will configure the
`blog_config.json` for and install dependencies and setup git for you.

`npm install -g gitpushblog-generator` and then `gitpushblog-generator repo_name`

then you can simply run the four commands **generate**,**dev**,**upload** and **deploy**

## 2. Forking this repository
- `fork` this repository
- enable `issues` in the forked repository (in repository settings)
- change the name of the repository if you want.
- `clone` the forked repository.
- run `npm install`
- manually configure `blog_config.json`
- run the npm scripts as described in the usage section

# Comments
Comments are important part of a blog. **gitpushblog** has four comment states.
- `disabled` : if `true` comments will be disabled completely
- `isGithub` : if `true` the github comments of the issue will be listed,
one has to visit the `issue` on github to make a comment like [this blogpost](http://donw.io/post/github-comments/)
- `isGithubAuth` : if `true`, a comment box will appear under the post and firebaseAuth for github will
be there to authenticate the user. (there's an issue with the permissions)
- `isDisqus` : if `true` Disqus comments will be added
(recommend not having `isDisqus` and `isGithub` **both** turned to `true`, it will act as disabled anyway if you do so)

# Usage
A simple usecase is just having all posts in the `posts` directory and generating the `index` pages
but a blog is more than that so **gitpushblog** has builtin disqus and github comment along with **offline** support
so that if you don't have access to the *new issue* page on github, you can just write the post in `markdown` and
upload your posts when you have internet connection.
*(technically, it just creates a new issue on your repo with the markdown content)*

So, let's start by configuring `blog_config.json`

### blog_config.json
HELP NEEDED: **firebase api keys public?**. In the repository, I have my firebase app details given in the `blog_config.json`
so that you can just test out the firebase GithubAuth thing.
for example we'll use this repository: https://github.com/lukego/blog/issues

a sample is given below:
- **username**: repository owner github username
- **author**: issue creator github username
- **repo**: repository name
- **comment object**: it just has the comment states as mentioned above along with some additional info.
- **firebaseConfig**: the firebase config object for webapps(get it on the firebase console)
```json
{
  "username": "lukego",
  "author": "lukego",
  "repo": "blog",
  "posts_per_page": "6",
  "comments_per_page": "3",
  "comment": {
    "disabled": false,
    "isGithub": true,
    "isDisqus": false,
    "isGithubAuth": true,
    "disqus_id": "geekodour"
  },
  "firebaseConfig": {
    "apiKey": "...",
    "authDomain": "...",
    "databaseURL": "...",
    "projectId": "...",
    "storageBucket": "...",
    "messagingSenderId": "..."
  }
}
```

### npm scripts
`npm scripts` are the main workhorses, there are quite a few `npm scripts` for developers but, just four
for someone just wanting to setup and start blogging.
- `npm run generate` : generate the deployable version in `dist` directory. files are minified.
- `npm run dev` : generate a watch mode enabled build in the `dev` directory
with developer options such as sourcemaps etc.
- `npm run upload`: upload the contents of the `content` direcory. see offline section for more details.
- `npm run deploy`: put the contents of the dist folder into `gh-pages` branch, so on the next push, if github
pages is set to `gh-pages` branch, the new content is available on the site. (**deploy is not written yet, will do that soon**)

### Offline
When offline you can write your posts in `markdown` inside the `contents` directory.
and when online you can upload them to github.
> using `npm run dev` will work offline, if it is not able to connect to githubapi
> it will just use the contents of the `content` directory as posts, if it can connect
> to the API both(content directory+github issue data) will be shown.
> but `npm run generate` will **only** fetch information from github api.

Github needs you to have authenticated to create an issue, in other words to create a blog post.
so, can't have the `api token` floating around in the repo. So for offline support i used
`.dotenv` for having the `github personal api token` as an env variable.
just make a `.env` file and put in your github personal api token like this. *(the `.env` file is gitignored)*
```
GITHUB_AUTH_TOKEN=6565THIS_IS_MY_TOKEN65565
```
now running `npm run upload` will upload the posts inside `content` directory, after successful upload it will clear up
the `content` directory.

# Templates details
The templates are created using nunjucks, though template authors can write templates the way the want
but for the comment system to work properly they have to add three 

If you're using react or any other javascript framework for making the blog you should
check the `main.js` file inside

# Todo
- [ ] Make the `main.sass` file cleaner and organized
- Will add more todo soon.. there's a lot of them.

# Contribute
- It will be awesome if anyone can help in creating some themes, it's almost just plain HTML and CSS
- will add issues and more contributing info soon.

# Eating my own dogfood
created this github api wrapper called [github-blog-api](https://github.com/geekodour/github-blog-api) to help with the github api calls
